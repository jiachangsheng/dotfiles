this file." t)

Initialize `org-registry-alist'.
If FROM-SCRATCH is non-nil or the registry does not exist yet,
create a new registry from scratch and eval it. If the registry
exists, eval `org-registry-file' and make it the new value for
`org-registry-alist'.

;;; Generated autoloads from org-screenshot.el

(autoload 'org-screenshot-take "org-screenshot" "\
Take a screenshot and insert link to it at point, if image
display is already on (see \\[org-toggle-inline-images])
screenshot will be displayed as an image

Screen area for the screenshot is selected with the mouse, left
click on a window screenshots that window, while left click and
drag selects a region. Pressing any key cancels the screen shot

With `C-u' universal argument waits one second after target is
selected before taking the screenshot. With double `C-u' wait two
seconds.

With triple `C-u' wait 3 seconds, and also rings the bell when
screenshot is done, any more `C-u' after that increases delay by
2 seconds

(fn &optional DELAY)" t)

Rotate last screenshot with one of the previously taken
screenshots from the same directory. If DIR is negative, rotate
in the other direction

;;; Generated autoloads from ox-freemind.el

(autoload 'org-freemind-export-to-freemind "ox-freemind" "\
Export current buffer to a Freemind Mindmap file.

If narrowing is active in the current buffer, only export its
narrowed part.

If a region is active, export that region.

A non-nil optional argument ASYNC means the process should happen
asynchronously.  The resulting file should be accessible through
the `org-export-stack' interface.

When optional argument SUBTREEP is non-nil, export the sub-tree
at point, extracting information from the headline properties
first.

When optional argument VISIBLE-ONLY is non-nil, don't export
contents of hidden elements.

When optional argument BODY-ONLY is non-nil, only write code
between \"<body>\" and \"</body>\" tags.

EXT-PLIST, when provided, is a property list with external
parameters overriding Org default settings, but still inferior to
file-local settings.

Return output file's name.
