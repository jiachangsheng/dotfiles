Usage: doom COMMAND [ARGS...]

A command line interface to Doom Emacs.

Includes package management, diagnostics, unit tests, and byte-compilation.

This tool also makes it trivial to launch Emacs out of a different folder or
with a different private module.

COMMANDS:
  version      Show installed versions of Doom, Doom modules, and Emacs.
  help         Show documentation for a Doom CLI command.
  info         Print detailed information about your config for bug reports.
  
  emacs:
    gc         Deletes orphaned packages & repos, and compacts them.
  
  Config Management:
    env [бн]   (Re)generates envvars file from your shell environment.
    install    Installs and sets up Doom Emacs for the first time.
    profiles   An obsolete alias for 'doom profile sync --all'.
  
  Development:
    ci [бн]    Commands that automate development processes.
    make [бн]   (Re)Generate project files and boilerplate.
    run        Launch Doom Emacs or an Emacs sandbox
  
  Module commands:
    +org [бн]   Commands to invoke Org's powerful capabilities.
  
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
  $EMACS
    The Emacs executable or command to use for any Emacs operations in this or
    other Doom CLI shell scripts (default: first emacs found in $PATH).
  
  $EMACSDIR
    The location of your Doom Emacs installation (defaults to ~/.config/emacs or
    ~/.emacs.d; whichever is found first). This is *not* your private Doom
    configuration. The --emacsdir option also sets this variable.
  
  $DOOMDIR
    The location of your private configuration for Doom Emacs (defaults to
    ~/.config/doom or ~/.doom.d; whichever it finds first). This is *not* the
    place you've cloned doomemacs/doomemacs to. The --doomdir option also sets
    this variable.
  
  $DOOMPAGER
    The pager to invoke for large output (default: "less +g"). The --pager
    option also sets this variable.
  
  $DOOMPROFILE
    Which Doom profile to activate (default: "_@0"). The --profile option
    also sets this variable.
  
  $DOOMPROFILELOADFILE
    Doom generates a profile loader script on 'doom sync' or 'doom profiles
    sync'. By default, this file is written to and loaded from
    $EMACSDIR/profiles/load.el. Set this envvar to change that. Note that this
    envvar must be in scope for both interactive and non-interactive sessions
    for it to be effective. This is especially useful for folks on Nix/Guix, who
    have deployed Doom to a read-only directory.
  
    Note: this file *must* end with a .el extension. It will be byte-compiled
    after it is generated.
  
  $DOOMPROFILELOADPATH
    A colon-delimited (semi-colon on Windows) list of profile config files or
    directories under which Doom will search for implicit profiles. See
    `var:doom-profile-load-path' for its default value.
  
EXIT CODES:
  0        Successful run
  1        General internal error
  2        Error with Emacs/Doom install or execution context
  3        Unrecognized user input error
  4        Command not found, or is incorrect/deprecated
  5        Invalid, missing, or extra options/arguments
  6-15     Reserved for Doom
  16-192   Reserved for the user's extensions
  254      Successful run (then execute the dynamically generated after-script)
  255      Uncaught critical errors
